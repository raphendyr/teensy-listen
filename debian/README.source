teensy-listen for Debian
------------------------

Source is distributed as bundled zip archive, which is not valid debian original tar ball.

First unzip, remove binary files and other irrelevant files and create tar.gz.

Use `git-import-orig teensy-listen.tar.gz`

No we have new upstream release imported into git and merged into master (debian branch).

Use `gbp-pq switch` to switch between patch queue and master.

Use `gbp-pq export` to create debian/paches from patch queue.

USe `git-dch -a -R|-S` to create changelog entry from git commits (-R = release, -S = snapshot).
